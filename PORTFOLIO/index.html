 <P>
  I was so young, at that time I was not even knowing what is coding, and also this that the games which I used to play are made up of such codes which create various interesting and attractive games,,so that we enjoy the thril and fun of the game.
  and also some games or apps give us knowledge about various things which we don't even know..but further when I came to 7th standard I came to know about whitehatJr coding classes and then I just gave a trial to this then there I started my journey of coding classes
  then I really wished to enroll and got enrolled too.and now it's been a year learning coding and now I am a Game Developer too! and soon I want to achieve and get success in my life by various professions.

  Coding entered into my life when I was in 7th standard..At tht point of time I was so nervous. Butstill I was so excited to attend that class, and on that day due to some network issue I was unable to take the trial class! after that I scheduled another class and there I had a good time spent learning about coding with the great teacher MISS.SHANIYA NISAR MA'AM. Who had been so friendly,creative,teacher with me throughout the year and also she is!
   after 1 year I am here, developing games and creating apps and also now I am certified as a game developer...I and my family is so happy about this..And my parents are so proud of me because I am done with this!
